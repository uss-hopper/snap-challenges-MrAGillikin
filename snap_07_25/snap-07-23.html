		<p>1. The five types of branching in git flow are: the master branch, which is the center that should be changed only when necessary, development branch, which is used for actual work, hotfix branching, where an emergency breakdown of the master branch must be fixed and merged back in quickly, feature branches where specific features are worked on before being merged into develop, release branch which represents a major milestone and is made available to clients, and finally there can be forked branches which go in different directions altogether.</p>
